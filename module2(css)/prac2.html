        <h1>Garlic Soup</h1>        
        <p>
            Garlic soup has been used for centuries as a home remedy, especially during cold and flu season. Its health benefits are largely due to allicin (a sulfur compound formed when garlic is crushed or chopped) and other antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. Here are some key benefits: <br>
            Boosts Immunity – Garlic has natural antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties. It can help stimulate white blood cells and fight infections. <br>
            Reduces Cold & Flu Symptoms – Can help ease congestion, reduce severity of cold symptoms, and promote faster recovery.
